  PREAMBLE

    0. Opening.

        The Free and Fair Software License (FFSL) is a free
      software license that grants users the rights to use,
      copy, modify, and distribute software and its
      associated documentation, while ensuring that the
      freedom to do so is preserved for all derivative
      works. This license is inspired by the collaborative
      spirit of open-source development and aims to promote
      fairness by requiring that any work incorporating
      original or Incorporated Component of the licensed
      software remain available under the same terms.

    1. Use Case.

        This license applies to any program or work which
      contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
      stating that it is governed by the terms of this Free
      and Fair Software License. By using, modifying, or
      distributing the work, you indicate your acceptance
      of this license, and all its terms and conditions.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    0. Definitions.

        This License applies to any work licensed under its
      terms, hereinafter referred to as the "Software." The
      "Software" includes the original program, any
      derivative works, source code, object code, and
      associated documentation. A "Incorporated Component"
      is any portion of the Software derived from or
      originally included in the work as distributed by the
      copyright holder. A "Derivative Work" is any work
      containing Incorporated Components or based on the
      Software.

    1. Grant of Copyright License.

        Subject to the terms of this License, each
      contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
      Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, sublicense, and distribute the Software and
      such Derivative Works in source or object form.

    2. Grant of Patent License.

        Subject to the terms of this License, each
      contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free patent license under licensed patents to
      make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
      and otherwise transfer the Software, provided such
      patent license applies only to those patent claims
      licensable by the contributor that are necessarily
      infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by
      combination of their contribution(s) with the
      Software to which such contribution(s) was submitted.

    3. Redistribution.

        You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Software or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
      with or without modifications, and in source or
      object code form, provided that you meet the
      following conditions:

      a) You must give any other recipients of the Software
      or Derivative Works a copy of this License.

      b) You must cause any modified files to carry
      prominent notices stating that you changed the files
      and the date of any change.

      c) You must retain, in the source form of any
      Derivative Work that includes Incorporated
      Components, the copyright notice, this list of
      conditions, and the disclaimer of warranty found in
      this License.

      d) If the Software or Derivative Work includes a
      "NOTICE" file as part of its distribution, then any
      Derivative Work including Incorporated Components
      must include a readable copy of the attribution
      notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
      Derivative Work.

      e) If the Software or Derivative Work incorporates
      any Incorporated Component comprising no less than
      one function block (defined as a distinct, reusable
      unit of code performing a specific task), you must
      include a "NOTICE" file in the distribution. This
      NOTICE file is the sole location for providing
      attribution for all Incorporated Components.
      Attribution must include the name of the Incorporated
      Component, the date of its inclusion, and the proper
      copyright or attribution notice as specified by the
      original copyright holder. No attribution notices for
      Incorporated Components shall be included in other
      files where such components are incorporated,
      ensuring all attribution is consolidated within the
      NOTICE file.

    4. Source Code.

        The work must be made available in a form that
      includes the complete corresponding source code,
      which must be the preferred form for making
      modifications. You must provide a means to obtain
      this source code, at no or minimal charge, for a
      period of at least one year after you distribute the
      object code.

    5. Copyleft Requirement.

        Any Incorporated Component included in a Derivative
      Work must be cited in the NOTICE file as licensed
      under the Free and Fair Software License. You may add
      your own copyright statement to your modifications
      and may provide additional or different license terms
      and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution
      of your modifications, or for any work that does not
      include Incorporated Components, provided that you do
      not thereby expand or limit the ability of recipients
      to use, copy, modify, or distribute the Incorporated
      Components under this License.

    6. Termination.

        This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate automatically if you fail to comply with
      the terms and conditions of this License. However,
      parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
      under this License will not have their licenses
      terminated provided such parties remain in full
      compliance.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, the Software is provided on an "AS IS"
      BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without
      limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
      NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The entire risk as to the quality
      and performance of the Software is with you.

    8. Limitation of Liability.

        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort(including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
      and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
      in writing, shall any contributor be liable to you
      for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use
      or inability to use the Software (including but not
      limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
      stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
      all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
      contributor has been advised of the possibility of
      such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

        While redistributing the Software or Derivative
      Works thereof, you may choose to offer, and charge a
      fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights
      consistent with this License. However, in accepting
      such obligations, you may act only on your own behalf
      and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other contributor.

    10. Trademarks.

        This License does not grant permission to use the
      trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
      names of the contributor, except as required for
      reasonable and customary use in describing the origin
      of the Software and reproducing the content of the
      NOTICE file.
